Work in progress: a command line tool for adding Google Calendar events. Written in Go. 

The tool utilizes the great package [cli](https://github.com/codegangsta/cli) written by [codegangsta](https://github.com/codegangsta).

The project serves as a personal introduction to Go and Google APIs. Some links that I'm using for reference include:
